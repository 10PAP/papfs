## Idea
Memory bandwidth and capacity are known perfomance bottlenecks of modern computer systems. Our goal is to design a hardware module capable of increasing memory capacity and memory bandwidth by dynamically compressing data in main memory fully transparently to user/system-level software.

## Risks
* Breakthrough in information theory can be difficult to exploit in practice \
Pos. solution: prefer papers with sufficient (and presented :)) experimental results

* It's a research project - there are just a few working implementations around \
Pos. solution: inspect as many existing projects as we can

## MVP
At the end of the semester: Verilog-written description of a hardware-based compressor/decompressor with random-access capabilities
