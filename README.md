## Idea
Disk bandwidth and capacity are extremely important in the modern world of big data. Companies have a lot of information to store and retrieve; the storage must be as efficient as possible both in terms of space and access time. Our goal is to design a FUSE-filesystem capable of increasing disk capacity and bandwidth by dynamically compressing data fully transparently to user/system-level software, exploiting techniques from information theory.

## Risks
* Breakthrough in information theory can be difficult to exploit in practice \
Pos. solution: prefer papers with sufficient (and presented :)) experimental results

* It's a research project - there are just a few working implementations around \
Pos. solution: inspect as many existing projects as we can

## MVP
At the end of the semester: fully-capable filesystem, which can be simply mounted with a few bash commands.
